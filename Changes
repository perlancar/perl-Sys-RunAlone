0.13	2017-09-21
	- Allow silence to be passed by environment variable.
	  Add new maintainer.

0.12	2012-04-04
	- Change in the test-suite so that tests should also run ok on Windows
	  with Strawberry Perl.

0.11	2012-04-01
	- Some code esthetics.  Verified it runs under 5.14.2, threaded and
	  unthreaded.

0.10	2011-05-10
	- Added "retry" functionality for often called cronjobs that may exceed
	  their allotted wallclock time occasionally.

0.09	2009-05-13
	- Added "silent" option so that a script can indicate whether or not it
	  wants to tell the world whether it saw a previous incarnation running.

0.08	2008-03-25
	- Given up after almost a week getting the test to complete without
	  errors.  Added two TODO sections: manual testing indicates that
	  everything seems to work as it should, so I guess it must be some
	  test-suite artefact causing problems.

	- Added support for SKIP_SYS_RUNALONE environment variable to skip the
	  functionality altogether.  After a feature request by Rick Jansen.
	  Made the code a little more adhering to PBP.

0.07	2006-11-15
	- Why did testing just go ok and wrong now?  Argh, must be too late.
	  Fix for warning and test error.

0.06	2006-11-15
	- Brought up to BPB standards.  Made the error message if no DATA handle
	  found, hopefully more understandable.

0.05	2006-06-11
	- Added caveat of scripts being edited.

0.04	2005-07-11
	- Some pod fixes.  Added link to Sys::RunAlways.

0.03	2005-06-10
	- Oops. Still one more race condition to fix in test-suite.

0.02	2005-06-10
	- Hopefully fixed problem with race conditions in the test-suite.

0.01    2005-06-09
